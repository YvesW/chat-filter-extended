# Example
An example greeter plugin


GIM chat support has not been tested since I don't have a GIM. It should likely behave like the CC filter.


FC/CC/Guest CC members remembered till logout or smth (well till leaving channel so also hopping/logout for FC and guest CC, but only logout for CC?)
Raid remembered till x y z for reasons such as splitting, also takes into account applying at tob/toa, at cox it checks x and y such as zone or like fc is then the same
Maybe add some of this stuff to an advanced config?
RL Party: cleared on logout & hopping probs.
Tob: when applying to a team/when someone applies to your team, when in lobby, when in raid => reset when hopping/logging out? also when e.g. entering toa lobby? also add reset button
Toa: toa board (including applicants of your party/when you apply to someone's party), toa lobby party interface, toa in raid => reset when hopping or logging out, also when entering other raid lobby? also add reset button
Cox: in een party en in cox bank zone, in cox lobby, in cox raid. resets on hop and logout, maybe also when joining other raid area? add reset option
FC:
Clan: including guests
Guest clan: including guests
Maybe gim idk:
Friends:
Public?: everything that is not part of the above categories probs

Also everything 2d for public (overhead)

Clears when it clears because it's jarring if a lot of messages suddenly disappear when you quickly hop worlds, or briefly leave your cc/fc (default advanced settings have been chosen with this in mind)

Thanks to Annotated for helping me collect Vars/ScriptIds and for extensively helping me test the plugin!
