# Example
An example greeter plugin


GIM chat support has not been tested since I don't have a GIM. It should likely behave like the CC filter.


FC/CC/Guest CC members remembered till logout or smth (well till leaving channel so also hopping/logout for FC and guest CC, but only logout for CC?)
Raid remembered till x y z for reasons such as splitting, also takes into account applying at tob/toa, at cox it checks x and y such as zone or like fc is then the same
Maybe add some of this stuff to an advanced config?
Party: cleared on hop and logout probs.
Tob: when applying to a team/when someone applies to your team, when in lobby, when in raid => reset when hopping/logging out? also when e.g. entering toa lobby?
Toa:
Cox:
FC:
Clan: including guests
Guest clan:
Maybe gim idk:
Friends:
Public?:


Thanks to Annotated for helping me collect Vars/ScriptIds and for extensively helping me test the plugin!
