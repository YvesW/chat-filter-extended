PM GIM chat support has not been tested since I don't have a GIM. It should likely behave like the CC filter.


FC/CC/Guest CC members remembered till logout or smth (well till leaving channel so also hopping/logout for FC and guest CC, but only logout for CC?)
Raid remembered till x y z for reasons such as splitting, also takes into account applying at tob/toa, at cox it checks x and y such as zone or like fc is then the same
